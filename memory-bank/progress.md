# Progress: Django Order Management System

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Initial Setup
**Status**: Project initiated, planning completed, basic structure in place

## What Works

- Django 5.0.x installation complete
- Basic project structure created with `project_config`
- Memory Bank documentation created for project guidance

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1 (Current)

#### Foundation Setup
- [ ] Create `core_app` Django application
- [ ] Implement settings structure with dev/prod separation
- [ ] Set up environment variables with python-decouple
- [ ] Configure static files with WhiteNoise

#### Core Models
- [ ] Create Company model
- [ ] Implement custom User model with Company FK
- [ ] Create Resource model with categorization
- [ ] Implement Order and OrderItem models
- [ ] Set up database migrations

#### Security & Authentication
- [ ] Implement row-level security via query filtering
- [ ] Set up basic authentication
- [ ] Configure permission system for different user roles

#### Basic Views
- [ ] Create base templates with Bootstrap 5
- [ ] Implement CompanyRestrictedMixin
- [ ] Create CRUD views for core models
- [ ] Implement dashboard view

### Phase 2 (Upcoming)

#### User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add filtering with django-filter
- [ ] Implement pagination (25 items/page)
- [ ] Add HTMX for interactive elements (if needed)

#### Admin Interface
- [ ] Configure admin views for all models
- [ ] Add company filters to admin views

#### Testing
- [ ] Set up pytest-django
- [ ] Create fixtures with factory_boy
- [ ] Write model tests
- [ ] Write view tests

#### Deployment
- [ ] Configure WhiteNoise for static files
- [ ] Set up waitress as WSGI server
- [ ] Configure Nginx (for production)
- [ ] Implement error handling with Sentry

## Known Issues

- No current issues as the project is in initial setup phase

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Current | Single-app architecture | Avoids premature boundaries, keeps codebase focused |
| Current | SQLite for production | Adequate for expected load, simplifies deployment |
| Current | Server-side rendering | Simplifies development, adequate for CRUD app |
| Current | UUIDs for primary keys | Security best practice to avoid sequential ID exposure |

## Evolution of Project Approach

### Initial Approach (Current)
- Focus on simplicity and maintainability
- Lean implementation with minimal dependencies
- Standard Django patterns for CRUD operations
- Multi-tenancy via company association and query filtering

### Future Considerations
- Potential migration to SSO authentication
- Possible enhancement with more interactive UI elements
- Consideration of more advanced reporting features
- Potential optimization for higher concurrent user loads if needed

## Key Learning Points

- Project is structured to balance simplicity with proper software engineering practices
- Multi-tenancy requires careful consideration at all application layers
- Row-level security implementation is critical for proper data isolation

## Metrics & Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Complete core models | Not set | Not started |
| Implement basic CRUD | Not set | Not started |
| Security implementation | Not set | Not started |
