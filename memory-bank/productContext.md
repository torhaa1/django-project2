# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
- **Resource Management**: Unified system for ROV/Survey equipment and personnel

3. **Financial Tracking**: Record planned costs, update actuals (manual by Nexans)
4. **User Access**: Role-based views, row-level filtering, simple authentication

## User Experience
- **Nexans**: Full access, admin control, financial oversight
- **REACH**: Survey resources/orders only, no visibility of IKM data
- **IKM**: ROV resources/orders only, no visibility of REACH data
- **All Users**: Simple interface, PC-focused design, efficient workflows
